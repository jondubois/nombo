# Synopsis

### EventVat is an evented in-process key/value store with an API like that of Redis. It's event based, which means that when a method is called that affects the data, corresponding events will be raised. It supports 5 data types, Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Arrays and Hashes.

# Motivation

 - A datastore for small, volitile working sets
 - For processes who do not share data, it reduces unnecessary trips across the process boundary.
 - Portability, works in the browser and on the server.
 - Write to any storage end-point (such as local browser storage, a filesystem or couchdb).

# Installation

```bash
$npm install eventvat
```

# Usage
Each new instance of `EventVat` is a hash. There are lots of convenient methods attached to each new instance.

## events
EventVat uses <a href="https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2">EventEmitter</a>. Listeners can attached to an EventVat object. An EventVat object can emit and event and a listener will respond. An event has three characteristics, the event name, a listener and an associated data key or wildcard.

```javascript
  var vat = EventVat();

  vat.on('get foo', function(key, value)


    console.log('`' + key + '` has the value: `' + value + '`');
  });

  vat.set('foo', 'hello, world');
  vat.get('foo');
```
